# Multi Measurement Device - Glasgow Robotics Team Alpha

## Abstract

The main purpose of this concept is to offer a compact, commercially oriented, low cost product which can acquire, compute and display various measurements.
The proposed prototype is based on the NXP MBED LPC1768 microcontroller and several breakout board modules which are interfaced via custom designed double-sided PCB (Printed Circuit Board). 
This device is not revolutionary however it provides several technologies into a single package. In terms of pricing the budget limit for the prototype was set at a maximum of Â£120, including manufacturing, components and breakout boards. The total cost for production in large quantities could be reduced further by combining all of the separate modules into a single more complicated PCB design. 
This approach will also reduce the physical size of the device and the manufacturing costs. 
However due to time limitations and the fact that the device has been developed by students as an extracurricular activity, it was decided that the prototype would be as simplified as possible in terms of hardware but fully functional.
